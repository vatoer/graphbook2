# Chapter 5, Reusable React Components and React Hooks
-  Introducing React patterns
-  Structuring our React application
-  Extending Graphbook
-  Documenting React applications

##  Introducing React patterns
-  Controlled components
-  Functional components
-  Conditional rendering
-  Rendering children

### Functional components
```sh
mkdir src/client/components
touch src/client/components/loading.js
```

### Conditional rendering
### Rendering child components

## Structuring our React application
### The React file structure

## Efficient Apollo React components
### Using fragments with Apollo
```sh
mkdir src/client/apollo/queries
mkdir src/client/apollo/fragments
```

### Reusing Apollo Hooks
```sh
mkdir src/client/apollo/mutations
```

cleaned up the functional component from most of the GraphQL request logic and
have it in separate files
